# Making a clock face

A clock face is one Python function that turns a usage snapshot into a 240×240 picture.
The clock only ever receives that picture.
Faces still receive at most three provider rows. When four services are configured, TokenTV
alternates pages every ten seconds before calling your render function. `render_page(data, 0)`
and `render_page(data, 1)` preview each page; `render_page(data, None)` follows the live rotation.

Digital, Neon and Pixel share the information shown by Pixel Retro and Sci-Fi HUD:
time/date, remaining short-window and weekly capacity, separate reset timers,
and any banked reset credits with their earliest expiry. Their gauges fill with
remaining capacity, while warning colours follow quota used. Space is a separate
animated face and retains its used-quota tags. `quota_metrics()` in `display.py`
keeps missing windows unknown instead of treating a weekly reading as a 5-hour one.

## 1. Try a face without touching the code

First set up the repository once, as in the [Game Boy example](../examples/gameboy#run-it-no-clock-no-login-no-fork)
(clone, then `.venv` with `pip install -e .`). Commands on this page then use `.venv/bin/python` for `python3`.
Save this as `my_face.py` in the repository root and run `.venv/bin/python my_face.py`.
It draws one line per provider with the same helpers the built-in faces use, from sample data.

```python
"""A tiny clock face: one line per provider. Run: .venv/bin/python my_face.py"""
import time

from token_tv.display import account_label, overview_rows
from token_tv.sample import D, H, snapshot
from token_tv.themes import Canvas, band, face, gauge, number_text, reading


def render_mono(data):
    cv = Canvas('#000000')
    for index, row in enumerate(overview_rows(data)):
        y = 8 + index * 78
        used, period, old, reset = reading(row)  # used is None when there is no reading
        cv.text((10, y), account_label(row), face('vt323.woff2', 20), '#c8c8c8')
        cv.text((10, y + 18), number_text(used), face('vt323.woff2', 40), '#ffffff')  # a dash, never a fake 0
        cv.text((230, y + 30), ('OLD ' if old else '') + reset, face('vt323.woff2', 20),
                '#ff5d8f' if old else '#c8c8c8', anchor='ra')
        gauge(cv, (10, y + 60, 230, y + 66), used, band('digital', used or 0), stale=old)
    return cv.finish()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    data = snapshot(time.time(), [
        ('claude_a', 'CLAUDE A', 'claude', [('5H', 72, 2 * H)]),
        ('codex_a', 'CODEX A', 'codex', [('WEEK', 15, 4 * D)]),
        ('grok_a', 'GROK A', 'grok', []),  # unknown: no window was reported
    ])
    data['accounts']['codex_a']['status'] = 'stale'  # an old reading must look old
    render_mono(data).save('my-face.png')
    print('wrote my-face.png')
```

Open `my-face.png`. Judge it at its real size too: the clock is 240 pixels wide and about
3 cm across, so text under about 9 px is hard to read.

## 2. Add it to TokenTV

1. Move the function into `token_tv/themes.py` and add it to `RENDERERS`.
2. Add its name to `STYLES` in `token_tv/display.py`. The dashboard's **Clock display** list
   reads `STYLES`, so the new face appears there without other changes.
3. Run `token-tv demo` (or `python3 -m token_tv demo`) and check `token-tv-demo/demo-<name>.jpg`.
4. Run `python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests`.
5. Optionally refresh the README sheet with `python3 scripts/render_clock_faces.py`.

## 3. Use it from your own fork — no approval needed

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/token-tv && cd token-tv
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e .
.venv/bin/token-tv demo     # your face from sample data; no config, login or clock needed
```

To show it on a real clock you need the normal setup first: a config (`token-tv setup`, or reuse
the one you already have with `--config`), logged-in accounts (`token-tv connect`, then
`token-tv doctor --live`) and `device_url` set to your clock. Then:

```bash
.venv/bin/token-tv run      # dashboard → Gallery
```

Your face is listed in the **Gallery** as **Local**. Press **Preview**, then the usual
**Apply to clock**. It works without any pull request; nothing is downloaded from anyone else.
Because the install is editable, later edits to your renderer show up after restarting `token-tv run`.

## 4. Share it (optional)

There are two different ways, and only the second one puts a face in the Gallery.

| | Share an image | Add it to the Gallery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How | [Share a face](https://github.com/click6067-ship-it/token-tv/issues/new?template=share_a_face.md) issue: an image, optionally the prompt and your fork link | A normal pull request with the [New clock face checklist](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/theme.md) copied in: id, name, author, license, a 240×240 preview from sample data |
| What happens | It is just shown in the issue. Nothing is added to the Gallery automatically | After review the maintainer adds it to `token_tv/assets/theme-catalog.json` (with `added_at`, `min_version` and a likes issue) in the next release |
| Who sees it | People reading the issue | Everyone on that release, in the **Gallery**, sorted by **Popular** or **New** |

Popular uses 👍 on each face's GitHub issue, counted by hand before releases (the Gallery shows when).
It is not a live ranking. Older installs show "update TokenTV" instead of downloading anything.

## Rules every face keeps

- **Sample data only.** Build previews with `token_tv.sample.snapshot`. Never paste real
  account names, emails or usage into issues, pull requests or images.
- **Unknown is not zero.** When `used` is `None`, draw a dash and an empty gauge (`gauge`
  does this for you). Never show `0%` for a missing reading.
- **Old is visibly old.** When `reading()` returns `old=True`, mark it (the built-in faces
  write `OLD` and hatch the gauge with `stale=True`).
- **Live text, not pictures of text.** Numbers and times must come from the snapshot.
- **One picture, 240×240, JPEG.** `render_page` saves the image; animated faces return GIF
  bytes like `token_tv/space.py`.
- Fonts must be in `token_tv/web/` with their license file next to them.

## Worked example

[Pixel → Game Boy](../examples/gameboy/README.md) includes the render function, the same sample data before and after, and an old/missing-data check. It was made with Claude Code and runs without a clock or account.
